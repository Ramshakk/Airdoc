 An AI-driven app for flight attendants manages medical emergencies onboard by recording and analyzing vital signs and symptoms. It predicts the criticality level, recommends medication, and initiates a video call with a doctor for serious cases, ensuring prompt and accurate treatment.
An AI-powered app tailored for flight attendants is pivotal in handling medical crises during flights. It employs sophisticated algorithms to efficiently monitor and interpret passengers' vital signs and symptoms mid-flight. This enables accurate prediction of crisis severity, ensuring swift and effective responses.

The app starts by recording vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels, while also noting symptoms such as pain or nausea. This comprehensive data gathering allows the AI system to gauge the emergency's seriousness accurately.

After analysis, the app predicts the crisis level. For less severe situations, it suggests appropriate medications based on the passenger's symptoms and medical history. These medications are then administered by flight attendants as needed, ensuring rapid access to the right treatment.

In more critical emergencies, the app initiates a video call with a medical expert. This real-time connection allows remote assessment and guidance, aiding flight attendants in making informed decisions and ensuring passengers receive optimal care, even in mid-air.

By integrating AI, this app not only streamlines emergency management but also elevates overall flight safety. Its data-driven approach and timely interventions mark a significant advancement in aviation healthcare, providing reassurance to passengers and crew alike.
